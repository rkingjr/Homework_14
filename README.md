# Homework 14: Tech Blog

## Description:

As someone who is making the leap into the tech industry, it is not only important for me to spend my time creating new apps, it is also import for me to read and write about the technical concepts I am learning. Having a tech blog to keep my thoughts on these concepts as well as developments in the industry would be quite handy.

With that in mind, this application serves as a blog where myself and other developers can publish their own blog posts and comment on the posts of others as well.

The application follows the MVC (models, views, controllers) framework for its architectural structure and uses Handlebars as the templating language, Sequelize for the ORM, and express-session for authentication.
